# Business-Management-System
<h2 align="left">Introduction:</h2>

A Business Management System (BMS) is a full system meant to streamline basic business activities by automating them. It ensures that consumer information, preferences, and interactions are documented for better service delivery, therefore enabling efficient management of them. Under tracking availability, price, and classification the system organizes product inventories. It allows role-based access as well as safe processing of administrative and personnel data, therefore enabling user management. The BMS also handles resolutions, schedules, and service requests, thereby regulating maintenance operations. Perfect entry management provides correct recording and monitoring of data, processes, and transactions, therefore supporting enhanced corporate performance and decision-making.
